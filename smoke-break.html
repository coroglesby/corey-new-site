<h3 class="poem-title">Smoke Break in the Key of FFFFF</h3>

<p class="line">I'd rather be inhaling the dust<br>
        from an old motel sign<br>
        as it bursts against the floor of a dumpster<br>
        I'd rather be swimming<br>
        into the paper sea lining the back of this aquarium<br>                    
        at least live in a town with charm independent<br>
        of rubber truck-hitch scrotums and<br>
        mudflap silhouettes and<br>
        it's always nights like this that end<br>
        with a call to what's-her-couch<br>
        to ask how she's been<br>
        because it's been 6:30pm for five years straight<br>
        and everyone already has a partner<br>
        even the partners<br>
        even the trash gulls at the shopping mall<br>
        that only seem to circle the occupied parking spots<br>
        despite me going out at night<br>
        to the empty spaces to draw<br>
        sidewalk chalk cars in their open arms and<br>
        no gulls when I check back each morning<br>
        just white splats of bird shit<br>
        and the usual tacky cummerbund of wet dog sky<br>
        between the mini forest on the median strip<br>
        and the permanent clouds<br>
        a thing I refuse to consider a horizon<br>
        a thing that helps me blame things<br>
        like restaurants and phone companies<br>
        for why it was me who got stuck here<br>
        with all the little voices I've been collecting:<br>
        You bummer<br>
        You heap of forgotten lawn debris<br>
        You sun-bleached and dead-eyed plastic owl<br>
        nailed to the aluminum corner of a bank roof<br>
        You vast, unfurnished acreage of Berber carpet in a bank<br>
        What have you done<br>
        Where have you gone<br>
        So-and-so climbed a mountain<br>
        So-and-so bought a house<br>
        You spent fast food cup lid with all the buttons pressed in<br>
        You don't even know what you are<br>
        You've been out here too long<br>
        You're needed inside</p>
