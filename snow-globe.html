<h3 class="poem-title">Commissioning a Snow Globe</h3>

<p class="line">The Mayor looks out<br>
across his constituency<br>
from the top floor of a hotel.<br>
<br>
Behind him, a woman<br>
unzips her thigh<br>
from a length of rose velour,<br>
wonders if it’s worth<br>
her time to ask what’s wrong.<br>
<br>
He’d been watching<br>
the cloud shadows inch<br>
water tower to water tower<br>
<br>
like an armada of bruises<br>
against the town’s flatness,<br>
casting zones in patches<br>
of temporary evening. Now,<br>
<br>
he finds himself fixed<br>
on one place in particular—<br>
a street called High View<br>
with a red house at the end.<br>
<br>
In the cellar, a man floats<br>
in a sensory deprivation tank<br>
he built from scratch. His son<br>
<br>
stands by the door, slowly turning<br>
the temperature dial<br>
toward boiling. He’s in too deep<br>
<br>
to notice. Upstairs, his wife<br>
combs through family albums,<br>
finds a shot of her husband<br>
<br>
decades younger and posing<br>
like he caught a Frisbee<br>
in his mouth. And if you can,<br>
<br>
make it so everyone is smiling.</p>
<br>

<h3 class="poem-title">In the Quiet Before a Hike, the Star Quarterback Experiences an Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response</h3>

<p class="line">It comes to him like warm air<br>
on the wrist after opening<br>
a microwave, when he imagines<br>
being in love. Or the way<br>
a poorly played piano rubs<br>
the mind, the misfired notes<br>
blurring together. Somewhere<br>
beyond the stadium’s glow<br>
a widow alphabetizes books<br>
she’s never read. A busboy<br>
takes the harsh drag of a first<br>
cigarette beside a dumpster.<br>
We are little hills of sound<br>
is the name of the play. Full row<br>
of hairy, painted chests rises, reads<br>
How Tall Would The Grass Get<br>
If You Didn’t Stomp It Back Down<br>
Every Other Night? Snap—<br>
ball disappears into white light.<br>
Someone’s always there.<br>
Touchdown. Clockwork. He is<br>
the center of the universe, finally<br>
unable to surprise itself. The crowd<br>
a bowl of bees, the applause<br>
heavy rain. The Chests:<br>
We Love You And We Are Sorry<br>
You Cannot Be One Of Us.</p>
