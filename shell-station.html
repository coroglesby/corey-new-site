<h3 class="poem-title">In a Shell Station</h3>

<p class="line">I like to say I hate it when people say this,<br>
    but sometimes it really is what it is,<br>
    like the man in front of me in line<br>
    buying two 99¢ microwave cheeseburgers<br>
    and a bag of cheeseburger-flavored chips,<br>
    and how I want to put him in a poem,<br>
    complicate my understanding<br>
    of his life a little bit, at least give him<br>
    something better to love<br>
    this much about cheeseburgers,<br>
    but there’s nothing I can do,<br>
    and nothing the cashier can do<br>
    but ring him up and comment on the snow,<br>
    and nothing<br>
    for the extremely Idahoan couple behind me to do<br>
    but shift in their cowboy boots, looking<br>
    completely gorgeous,<br>
    the way the snow falling outside is gorgeous,<br>
    all snowy around the gas station pavilion<br>
    like little shredded pieces<br>
    of my attempt at trying to describe it,<br>
    here in the shut mouth of the moment,<br>
    among grinning rows of spring-loaded cigarettes<br>
    and dud scratch-offs all rolled up<br>
    beneath the coin-scratched hockey pond<br>
    of the glass counter top,<br>
    and Bonnie Tyler, somewhere,<br>
    blowing her voice out with such intensity<br>
    that the kid with the gun has to shout twice<br>
    before any of us notice him.</p>
