<h3 class="poem-title">Walking home in the swelling shadow of the bomb</h3>

<p class="line">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;—I’m able to love<br>
    the abandoned amusement parks<br>
    in the dark, unhumming guts<br>
    of refrigerators lining this rezoned sidewalk<br>
    <br>
    and the boutique olive oil stores and tea shops that,<br>
    let’s face it,<br>
    are already on their way.<br>
    <br>
    I love the saliva<br>
    stalactites draping the inner jaws<br>
    of the daydreaming commuters<br>
    inching by me and up the exit ramps<br>
    and the great urban drain<br>
    they’ll circle home.<br>
    <br>
    I love breaking down<br>
    the ambiance of this part of town<br>
    into its various elements—<br>
    <br>
    the million post-coital yawns,<br>
    the woody, deep echoes of farts in lonely elevator cars<br>
    climbing the new stack of luxury condos<br>
    failing across the street<br>
    <br>
    and the security guard there,<br>
    swinging his thousand keys—I love<br>
    (though he’ll never buzz me in)<br>
    how green his eyes are,<br>
    how they engulf me, make me feel<br>
    like a spider in a celebrity’s Christmas tree.<br>
    <br>
    I’m crazy about this city—<br>
    <br>
    the thin shadows between the teeth of its strangers<br>
    who’ve taken my order/whose order I’ve taken,<br>
    the blur of commerce intoxicating.<br>
    <br>
    I love having my hair cut<br>
    in a new lover’s kitchen.<br>
    <br>
    I love the brainburn<br>
    stink of a particular gas station<br>
    restroom downtown<br>
    where the fluorescent flicker in a cracked mirror<br>
    once amplified the hissing rat I’d forgotten<br>
    was crawling the cage in my chest.<br>
    <br>
    I love mirrors, suddenly—especially<br>
    this storefront window,<br>
    how its warp tightens my midsection<br>
    <br>
    and the guy typing on the other side<br>
    thinks I’m smiling at him.<br>
    <br>
    I love the soapstone sky,<br>
    its refusal to be pretty.<br>
    <br>
    And speaking of pretty,<br>
    I’m going to turn here<br>
    down C Street to check in on Miranda,<br>
    my homeless friend<br>
    who, each morning, turns<br>
    a found candy bar wrapper inside out,<br>
    tucks its silver into her hair,<br>
    and asks me:<br>
    <br>
    <em>Do you like my jewelry?</em><br>
    <br>
    I love your jewelry, Miranda.<br>
    <br>
    And I love the community horoscope<br>
    new graffiti suggests,<br>
    penned nightly by the kids<br>
    living beneath the overpass—<br>
    <br>
    their lives a kind of overpass,<br>
    where some god too ashamed to show its face<br>
    adds pain to pain<br>
    until the stack seems to slow dance<br>
    with its own weight.<br>
    <br>
    Every potholed street named after a senator—<br>
    <br>
    every dead shadfly darkening<br>
    the plastic cover on a streetlight—<br>
    <br>
    the moon hanging shy in the smog<br>
    like an early guest contemplating knocking—<br>
    <br>
    here in the swelling shadow of the bomb,<br>
    I’m able to love all of it.<br>
    <br>
    Come on in, moon,<br>
    you barren wallflower<br>
    <br>
    and explain to me the story hidden in this wet ring<br>
    on the pavement in front of the 7-11<br>
    and the melting Coke Slurpee<br>
    that must’ve left it there. Don’t you, too, love<br>
    <br>
    whatever interruptions cause us to set down<br>
    what we desire for a moment, and talk?<br>
    And I want to talk<br>
    <br>
    to every coal mine canary ghost—to think<br>
    the dark world beneath so much of America<br>
    could be haunted<br>
    by the songs of birds! And I want to ask<br>
    <br>
    about the impossible, boneless system<br>
    of the leopard slug I just stepped on—<br>
    <br>
    how its entire body seems an ornate battery<br>
    with some single, secret mission.<br>
    I want to<br>
    <br>
    map the solar system<br>
    of sweaty pocket change<br>
    the bartender slid away from the drunk at the end<br>
    of the bar I just ducked into<br>
    <br>
    and the wet air beneath the glass<br>
    as it slapped the counter.<br>
    <br>
    If I had a bit more time, I could<br>
    learn to love feeling<br>
    as shapeless and bored as the nebula of pipe calcium<br>
    in this ice cube. I could even learn<br>
    <br>
    to love the strange odor<br>
    creeping from my neighbor’s crockpot,<br>
    <br>
    how it grows stronger<br>
    and stronger throughout the day,<br>
    looping like feedback. But for now,<br>
    <br>
    I’m content with the click<br>
    of my key in the door,<br>
    <br>
    and when I can afford it,<br>
    the concept of rent.</p>
    <br>
<br>

<h3 class="poem-title">Compliment</h3>

<p class="line">When the universe begins to rip apart<br>
    in they say about ten billion years,<br>
    I will still love your hair.<br>
    They say a lot of things, though.<br> 
    They say it’ll take a million years<br>
    for our laptops to decompose<br>
    and half that for Hale Bopp<br>
    to pop back out of ’97 trailing<br>
    311 and Goo Goo Dolls lyrics<br>
    through the turned-off television night,<br>
    and that around the same time, a soda bottle<br>
    will fall from the evacuated heavens<br>
    on a tiny bar napkin-parachute<br>
    with a yellowed note inside reading,<br>
    “Seriously, your hair looks great,”<br>
    though I added that last bit,<br>
    because when this charred and lifeless<br>
    stone slips into its eventual<br>
    bright death in the sun like an old man<br>
    being helped into a motel hot tub,<br>
    every scattered particle of me<br>
    will still feel this way about your hair.<br>
    I mean, look at the size of us.<br>
    Quick, come here, give me your number<br>
    before it gets so hot in this crampy little dive<br>
    all multicellular life forms turn<br>
    to glass cleaner and we’re just a couple<br>
    of nude protozoans trying to find the vague<br>
    genitalia on the molten plastic of us.<br>
    Quick, before language itself ceases to exist,<br>
    hence my taking this moment<br>
    to tell you how I feel about your hair<br>
    and claiming this wobbly stool, whereupon I will<br>
    perform now for any skeptics in attendance<br>
    my turn-into-an-enormous-moth trick—watch<br>
    how I drum my body against the light.</p>
